# Class Roster
Manipulates a database of students and can display certain students based on certain attributes. Program utilizes memory allocation and deallocation with pointers, enumerated datatypes, classes, objects, and arrays.
A project completed for a scripting and programming course in college written in C++.

SCENARIO:
You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student database to a new platform using C++ language. You are responsible for implementing the system based on specific requirements. A list of data is provided as part of these requirements. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data. You must write a program containing two classes. The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. Information about existing students sourced from the “studentData Table” in the assignment's resource files. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
